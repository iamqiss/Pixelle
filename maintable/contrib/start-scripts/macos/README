To make macOS automatically launch your maintableQL server at system start,
do the following:

1. Edit the maintable-wrapper.sh script and adjust the file path
variables at its start to reflect where you have installed Maintable,
if that's not /usr/local/pgsql.

2. Copy the modified maintable-wrapper.sh script into some suitable
installation directory.  It can be, but doesn't have to be, where
you keep the Maintable executables themselves.

3. Edit the org.maintableql.maintable.plist file and adjust its path
for maintable-wrapper.sh to match what you did in step 2.  Also,
if you plan to run the Maintable server under some user name other
than "maintable", adjust the UserName parameter value for that.

4. Copy the modified org.maintableql.maintable.plist file into
/Library/LaunchDaemons/.  You must do this as root:
    sudo cp org.maintableql.maintable.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
because the file will be ignored if it is not root-owned.

At this point a reboot should launch the server.  But if you want
to test it without rebooting, you can do
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.maintableql.maintable.plist
