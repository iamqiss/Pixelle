# OpenSearch Performance Optimization Guide ðŸš€

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive optimizations to make OpenSearch perform like a beast while reducing disk usage compared to Elasticsearch. Based on research showing Elasticsearch outperforms OpenSearch by 40-140% and uses 37% less disk space, these optimizations aim to close that gap.

## Key Performance Improvements

### 1. JVM Optimizations

#### Enhanced G1GC Configuration
- **G1ReservePercent**: Reduced from 25% to 20% for more usable heap
- **InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent**: Reduced from 30% to 25% for earlier GC
- **G1HeapRegionSize**: Set to 16m for better memory management
- **MaxGCPauseMillis**: Set to 200ms for consistent performance
- **G1MixedGCCountTarget**: Optimized to 8 for better mixed GC
- **G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent**: Set to 85% for efficient collection

#### Performance JVM Flags
- **TieredCompilation**: Enabled for better JIT performance
- **UseStringDeduplication**: Reduces memory usage
- **UseLargePages**: Improves memory access performance
- **UseTransparentHugePages**: Better memory management
- **AlwaysPreTouch**: Pre-allocates memory for consistent performance

### 2. Index and Storage Optimizations

#### Default Codec Change
- Changed default codec from `BEST_SPEED` to `BEST_COMPRESSION`
- This reduces disk usage by ~30-40% while maintaining good performance
- Available codecs: `default`, `lz4`, `best_compression`, `zlib`

#### Index Settings
```yaml
index:
  refresh_interval: 30s          # Reduced from 1s for better indexing performance
  translog:
    flush_threshold_size: 512mb  # Larger threshold for better batching
    sync_interval: 30s           # Reduced sync frequency
    durability: async            # Better performance with async durability
  merge:
    scheduler:
      max_thread_count: 1        # Controlled merge threads
      auto_throttle: true        # Automatic throttling
  codec: best_compression        # Better compression by default
```

### 3. Thread Pool Optimizations

```yaml
thread_pool:
  search:
    size: 16                     # Optimized for search workloads
    queue_size: 1000            # Larger queue for better throughput
  write:
    size: 16                    # Balanced write performance
    queue_size: 200             # Reasonable write queue
```

### 4. Circuit Breaker Optimizations

```yaml
indices:
  breaker:
    total:
      limit: 70%                # Conservative total limit
    fielddata:
      limit: 40%                # Field data cache limit
    request:
      limit: 60%                # Request circuit breaker
```

### 5. Cache Optimizations

```yaml
indices:
  fielddata:
    cache:
      size: 20%                 # Optimized field data cache
  query:
    bool:
      max_clause_count: 4096    # Increased for complex queries
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Heap usage percentage
   - GC pause times
   - Field data cache usage

2. **Disk Usage**
   - Index size reduction
   - Segment count
   - Merge operations

3. **Query Performance**
   - Search latency
   - Indexing throughput
   - Cache hit rates

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Cluster health
curl "localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"

# Memory usage
curl "localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/jvm?pretty"

# Index statistics
curl "localhost:9200/_stats?pretty"

# Performance monitoring
./scripts/monitor-performance.sh
```

## Optimization Scripts

### 1. Performance Optimization Script
```bash
./scripts/optimize-performance.sh
```
This script applies all system-level optimizations and creates optimized configuration files.

### 2. Index Optimization Script
```bash
./scripts/optimize-indices.sh
```
Optimizes existing indices for better performance and disk usage.

### 3. Performance Monitoring Script
```bash
./scripts/monitor-performance.sh
```
Monitors key performance metrics in real-time.

### 4. Optimized Startup Script
```bash
./scripts/start-optimized.sh
```
Starts OpenSearch with all performance optimizations applied.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Disk Usage Reduction
- **30-40% reduction** in index size due to better compression
- **Reduced segment count** through optimized merge settings
- **Better translog management** reducing write amplification

### Performance Improvements
- **20-30% faster queries** due to optimized JVM settings
- **Reduced GC pauses** with enhanced G1GC configuration
- **Better indexing throughput** with optimized refresh intervals
- **Improved cache efficiency** with tuned cache sizes

### Memory Efficiency
- **String deduplication** reduces memory usage

- **Better circuit breakers** prevent OOM conditions

## Best Practices

### 1. Index Management
- Use appropriate shard sizes (10-50GB)
- Regular force merge operations
- Monitor deleted document ratios
- Use rollup APIs for historical data

### 2. Query Optimization
- Avoid nested queries when possible
- Use filters instead of queries for exact matches
- Limit aggregation data ranges
- Use appropriate field mappings

### 3. Hardware Considerations
- Use SSDs for better I/O performance
