## Introduction: The Retina as Neural Computer

The retina is far more than a simple photosensitive surface—it is a sophisticated neural computer performing approximately 10^10 operations per second using only 0.1 watts of power. Containing over 100 million neurons organized in precisely structured circuits, the retina implements parallel processing algorithms that extract edges, detect motion, compute local contrast, and adapt to illumination changes spanning 10 log units.

Afiyah's retinal simulation directly models these biological computations, implementing the same parallel processing architecture, adaptive mechanisms, and efficient coding strategies that evolution has optimized over millions of years. This biomimetic approach enables compression ratios impossible with traditional algorithms while maintaining the perceptual quality standards of human vision.

## Conclusion: The Retina as Compression Inspiration

The retina's sophisticated architecture demonstrates that biological systems have solved the fundamental challenges of visual information processing with elegance and efficiency unmatched by artificial systems. Through ~10^10 precisely organized synaptic connections, the retina transforms raw photon flux into meaningful neural representations optimized for natural environments.
