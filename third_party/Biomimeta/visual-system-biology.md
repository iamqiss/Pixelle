## Introduction: The Most Sophisticated Information Processing System

The human visual system represents the pinnacle of biological information processing, evolved over millions of years to extract meaningful information from the electromagnetic spectrum with extraordinary efficiency and sophistication. Processing approximately 10^9 bits of visual information per second while consuming less than 20 watts of power, the visual system demonstrates computational principles that far exceed current artificial systems.

Afiyah's revolutionary compression technology directly mimics these biological processes, implementing computational models of retinal preprocessing, cortical feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and predictive coding that enable unprecedented compression ratios while maintaining perceptual fidelity.

## I. Ocular Anatomy and Light Capture

### Cornea and Anterior Optics
The cornea provides approximately 65-75 diopters of the eye's total refractive power (~60 diopters), with its precise curvature and transparency achieved through highly ordered collagen fibrils and controlled hydration levels maintained by endothelial pumps.

**Afiyah Implementation**: The `optical_preprocessing/corneal_modeling.rs` module simulates corneal aberrations and optical point spread functions, implementing pre-filtering that matches human optical limitations for perceptually optimized compression.

### Iris and Pupillary Dynamics
The iris contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, enabling dynamic aperture control from 1.5mm (bright conditions) to 8mm (dark conditions). This represents a 28-fold change in retinal illumination, with pupillary response times ranging from 200ms (constriction) to 5 seconds (dilation).

**Biological Significance**: Pupillary control serves as automatic gain control, preventing photoreceptor saturation while optimizing signal-to-noise ratios across illumination conditions.

**Afiyah Implementation**: Dynamic exposure control algorithms in `retinal_processing/pupil_adaptation.rs` model pupillary responses to implement scene-adaptive bit allocation strategies.

### Crystalline Lens and Accommodation
The lens provides 15-20 diopters of accommodative range in young adults, controlled by ciliary muscle contraction that releases zonular tension. Accommodation response times are approximately 350-400ms for distance-to-near shifts, with presbyopic changes beginning around age 40 due to lens sclerosis.

**Afiyah Implementation**: Focus-dependent processing in `optical_preprocessing/accommodation_modeling.rs` implements depth-of-field aware compression that prioritizes in-focus regions.

## II. Retinal Architecture and Information Processing

### Photoreceptor Layer: Primary Sensory Transduction

#### Rod Photoreceptors
Rods number approximately 120 million per eye, with peak density of ~160,000/mm² at 18° eccentricity. Single-photon sensitivity is achieved through the rhodopsin cascade, where one absorbed photon can close ~1000 sodium channels, producing a hyperpolarizing response of 1-2 mV.

**Spectral Sensitivity**: Peak sensitivity at 507nm with dynamic range spanning 6-8 log units through biochemical adaptation mechanisms including calcium feedback and rhodopsin regeneration kinetics.

**Temporal Characteristics**: Integration times of 100-200ms enable high sensitivity but limit temporal resolution to ~20 Hz under scotopic conditions.

- **M-cones (32%)**: Peak sensitivity 534nm, responsible for green perception  
- **S-cones (2%)**: Peak sensitivity 420nm, responsible for blue perception

**Foveal Specialization**: The foveal pit (1.2° diameter) contains exclusively cones at densities up to 199,000/mm², providing maximum acuity of ~60 cycles/degree.

**Color Processing**: Color perception emerges from opponent processing of cone signals:

### Horizontal Cell Layer: Lateral Processing
Horizontal cells create antagonistic surrounds for photoreceptors through GABA-mediated inhibition, implementing the first stage of center-surround processing. A1-type horizontal cells contact L and M cones, while A2-type cells specifically contact S cones.

**Functional Role**: Contrast enhancement, adaptation, and color constancy through spatial and chromatic opponency.

**Afiyah Implementation**: `retinal_processing/horizontal_inhibition.rs` models lateral inhibition networks for edge enhancement and adaptation.

### Bipolar Cell Layer: Parallel Processing Streams

#### ON and OFF Pathways
Bipolar cells segregate visual information into parallel ON (depolarizing to light increments) and OFF (depolarizing to light decrements) channels through differential glutamate receptor expression:
- **ON-center bipolars**: Express metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR6)
- **OFF-center bipolars**: Express ionotropic AMPA/kainate receptors

**Functional Significance**: Separate processing of light increments and decrements enables full utilization of the neural dynamic range and forms the foundation for contrast processing.

#### Cone Bipolar Subtypes
At least 10-12 distinct cone bipolar cell types exist, each with different temporal characteristics, spatial receptive fields, and output targets:
- **Sustained types**: Slow temporal responses, fine spatial resolution

## III. Central Visual Processing

### Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)
The LGN contains six laminated layers:

**Afiyah Implementation**: `central_processing/lgn_relay.rs` models gain control and attentional modulation of visual signals.

### Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
V1 contains approximately 200 million neurons organized in a columnar architecture with several key organizational principles:

#### Retinotopic Organization
V1 maintains a precise topographic map of visual space with cortical magnification factor M(E) = k/(E + E₂), where E is eccentricity and k, E₂ are constants. The foveal representation occupies disproportionate cortical area (~50% for central 10°).

#### Orientation Selectivity
Simple cells (25% of neurons) exhibit oriented receptive fields created by convergent LGN input, while complex cells (75% of neurons) show orientation selectivity with spatial phase invariance.

**Orientation Columns**: Systematic progression of preferred orientations across the cortical surface in ~180° cycles over 0.5-1.0mm.
