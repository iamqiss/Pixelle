    long_about = r#"Apache Iggy (Incubating) - A persistent message streaming platform written in Rust

Apache Iggy is a high-performance message streaming platform that supports QUIC, TCP, and HTTP 
transport protocols, capable of processing millions of messages per second with low latency.

WEBSITE:
    https://iggy.apache.org

REPOSITORY:
    https://github.com/apache/iggy

DOCUMENTATION:
    https://iggy.apache.org/docs

CONFIGURATION:
    The server uses a TOML configuration file. By default, it looks for 'configs/server.toml' 
    in the current working directory. You can override this with the IGGY_CONFIG_PATH environment
    variable or use the --config-provider flag.

    Examples:
        iggy-server                                    # Uses default file provider (configs/server.toml)
        iggy-server --config-provider file             # Explicitly use file provider
        IGGY_CONFIG_PATH=custom.toml iggy-server       # Use custom config file path

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    Any configuration value can be overridden using environment variables with the IGGY_ prefix.
    Use underscores to separate nested configuration keys (e.g., IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8090).

    Common examples:
        IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090                  # Override TCP server address
        IGGY_HTTP_ENABLED=true                         # Enable HTTP transport
        IGGY_SYSTEM_PATH=/data/iggy                    # Set data storage path
        IGGY_SYSTEM_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug                # Set log level to debug

TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS:
    - TCP (binary protocol): High-performance, low-latency (default: 127.0.0.1:8090)
    - QUIC: Modern UDP-based protocol with built-in encryption (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
    - HTTP: RESTful API for web integration (default: 127.0.0.1:3000, disabled by default)

GETTING STARTED:
    1. Start the server: iggy-server
    2. Install CLI: cargo install iggy-cli
    3. Create a stream: iggy stream create my-stream
    4. Create a topic: iggy topic create my-stream my-topic 1 none
    5. Send messages: echo "Hello, Iggy!" | iggy message send my-stream my-topic
