   *  in `RichSeq` inside [[SeqSupport]].

   *  Also note that you probably only want to use this function if your values are in a specific order, like in a `Vector` or in a `ListSet`. It doesn't make
   *  much sense if you have an unordered collection such as a `Set`. You probably want to reach for the standard `groupBy` in that case.

   *  @tparam K    the type of keys returned by the discriminator function.
   *  @tparam C    the type of the outer collection being returned.
   *  @tparam D    the type used to group elements with the same key.
   *  @return      a sequence of tuples each containing a key `k = f(x)` and all the elements `x` of the sequence where `f(x)` is equal to `k`.
