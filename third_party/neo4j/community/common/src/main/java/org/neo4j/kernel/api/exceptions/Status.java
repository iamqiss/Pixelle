    On naming...

    These are public status codes and users' error handling will rely on the precise names. Therefore, please take
    care over categorisation and classification and make sure not to introduce duplicates.

    Broadly, the naming convention here uses one of three types of name:

    1. For unexpected events, name with a leading noun followed by a short problem term in the past tense. For example,
       EntityNotFound or LeaseExpired. As a variant, names may omit the leading noun; in this case, the current
       ongoing operation is implied.

    2. For conditions that prevent the current ongoing operation from being performed (or being performed correctly),
       start with a leading noun (as above) and follow with an adjective. For example, DatabaseUnavailable. The
       leading noun may again be omitted and additionally a clarifying suffix may be added. For example,
       ForbiddenOnReadOnlyDatabase.

    3. For more general errors which have a well-understood or generic term available, the form XxxError may be used.
       For example, SyntaxError or TokenNameError.

    Where possible, evaluate naming decisions based on the order of the items above. Therefore, if it is possible to
    provide a type (1) name, do so, otherwise fall back to type (2) or type (3)

    Side note about HTTP: where possible, borrow words or terms from HTTP status codes. Be careful to make sure these
    use a similar meaning however as a major benefit of doing this is to ease communication of concepts to users.

    If you are unsure, please contact the Driver Team.
