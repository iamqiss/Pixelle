/**
 * This test simulates a scenario where you're upgrading from a MongoDB version with no extensions
 * to a loaded to a higher MongoDB version with an extension loaded. We test this expected behavior:
 *    - The nodes are spun up at a lower version with no extensions loaded. All $testFoo queries
 *      should be rejected, both in an agg command and in a createView pipeline.
 *    - In a ReplSet, $testFoo queries should be accepted once all binaries are upgraded (the
 *      primary last). Nothing is dependent on FCV. Note that we are missing coverage for ReplSet
 *      upgrade/downgrade where we aren't just connected to the primary the whole time
 *      (TODO SERVER-109457).
 *    - In a sharded cluster, $testFoo queries should be accepted once all binaries are upgraded
 *      (the mongos last), and again nothing is dependent on FCV.
 *       * However, there is one difference: in the period between when the shards start restarting
 *         until mongos has restarted, the cluster may allow you to create a view with $testFoo
 *         even though you cannot run queries on the view until mongos has upgraded. This behavior
 *         is flaky, as it occasionally rejets the view creation to begin with. Note that this only
 *         happens when auth is not enabed (see upgrade_enables_extension_foo_auth.js for testing
 *         with more consistent behavior when auth is enabled).
 *
 * TODO SERVER-109457 Investigate more ReplSet scenarios.
 *
 * TODO SERVER-109450 Auth-off cluster should have same behavior as auth-on cluster.
 * Extensions are only available on Linux machines.
 * @tags: [
 *   auth_incompatible,
 *   incompatible_with_macos,
 *   incompatible_with_windows_tls,
 * ]
