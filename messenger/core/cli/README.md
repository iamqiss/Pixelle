# Apache Messenger CLI

The interactive CLI allows you to interact with the Apache Messenger server from the command line.

This is a great addition to the Web UI, especially for all the developers who prefer using the console tools.

Messenger CLI can be installed with `cargo install messenger-cli` and then simply accessed by typing `messenger` in your terminal.
