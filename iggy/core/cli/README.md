# Apache Iggy CLI

The interactive CLI allows you to interact with the Apache Iggy server from the command line.

This is a great addition to the Web UI, especially for all the developers who prefer using the console tools.

Iggy CLI can be installed with `cargo install iggy-cli` and then simply accessed by typing `iggy` in your terminal.
