## How the script works üõ†Ô∏è
***
The script uses a combination of standard command-line tools like `find`, `grep`, `sed`, and `mv` to perform the renaming operations.

### Configuration
The script starts by defining two arrays: `old_names` and `new_names`. These arrays hold the **source** and **target** names, respectively. The `workspace_path` variable is set to the current directory (`.`) but can be changed to point to a specific root workspace.

### Functions
* **`rename_filesystem`**: This function handles the renaming of directories and files.
    * It uses **`find`** to locate directories and files with names containing the `old_name`. The `-depth` flag is crucial as it ensures directories are renamed from the bottom up, preventing errors where a parent directory is renamed before its contents.
    * The `find` command passes the list of found paths to a `while` loop using `print0` and `read -r -d ''` to handle paths with spaces or other special characters correctly.
    * **`mv`** is used to perform the actual renaming, with a nested `sed` command to replace the old name with the new one. The `-E` flag in `sed` enables extended regular expressions, and the `/gi` flags make the substitution global and **case-insensitive**.
* **`update_file_contents`**: This function updates the text inside the files.
    * **`grep -rlI`** is used to find files containing the `old_name`.
        * `-r`: recursive search
        * `-l`: lists the files that match, instead of printing the matching lines
        * `-I`: ignores binary files
    * The list of files from `grep` is then piped to a `while` loop.
    * **`sed -i ''`** performs an in-place edit of the files. The `''` after `-i` is specific to macOS and prevents `sed` from creating a backup file. If you're using Linux, you may need to remove this or use `-i''` without the space. The `s/old_name/new_name/gi` command performs a case-insensitive and global substitution of the old name with the new name.

### Main Logic
The script loops through the `old_names` and `new_names` arrays. For each pair, it first calls `update_file_contents` and then `rename_filesystem`. This order is important: if the files were renamed first, the `grep` command might not find them in the next step.
